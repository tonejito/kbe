Abstract

|                |         |
|:---------------|:--------|
| **Goal**       | Advanced container management features.
| **Objectives** | - Leverage how to avoid applications overusing system resources.
|                | - Review how Kubernetes evaluates application health status via probes and automatic application restart.
|                | - Create Kubernetes resources holding application configuration and secrets, and how to make that configuration available to running applications.
| **Sections**   | - Limiting Resource Usage (and Guided Exercise)
|                | - Proving Liveness, Readiness and Startup (and Guided Exercise)
|                | - Configuring Cloud Applications (and Guided Exercise)
