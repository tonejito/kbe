A [job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/) in Kubernetes is a supervisor for pods carrying out batch processes, that is,
a process that runs for a certain time to completion, for example a calculation
or a backup operation.

Let's create a [job](https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/blob/main/specs/jobs/job.yaml)
called `countdown` that supervises a pod counting from 9 down to 1:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/main/specs/jobs/job.yaml
```

You can see the job and the pod it looks after like so:

```bash
kubectl get jobs
```
```cat
NAME                      DESIRED   SUCCESSFUL   AGE
countdown                 1         1            5s
```

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
```cat
NAME              READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
countdown-qkjx8   0/1     Completed   0          2m17s
```

To learn more about the status of the job, do:

```bash
kubectl describe jobs/countdown
```
```cat

  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  3m18s  job-controller  Created pod: countdown-qkjx8
```

And to see the output of the job via the pod it supervised, execute:

```bash
kubectl logs countdown-qkjx8
```
```cat
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
```

To clean up, use the `delete` verb on the job object which will remove all the
supervised pods:

```bash
kubectl delete job countdown
```
```cat
job "countdown" deleted
```

Note that there are also more advanced ways to use jobs, for example,
by utilizing a [work queue](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/job/coarse-parallel-processing-work-queue/)
or scheduling the execution at a certain time via [cron jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/).
