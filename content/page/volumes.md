A Kubernetes volume is essentially a directory accessible to all containers
running in a pod. In contrast to the container-local filesystem, the data in volumes is preserved across container restarts. The medium backing a volume and its contents are determined by the volume type:

- node-local types such as `emptyDir` or `hostPath`
- file-sharing types such as `nfs`
- cloud provider-specific types like `awsElasticBlockStore`, `azureDisk`, or `gcePersistentDisk`
- distributed file system types, for example `glusterfs` or `cephfs`
- special-purpose types like `secret`, `gitRepo`

A special type of volume is `PersistentVolume`, which we will cover elsewhere.

Let's create a [pod](https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/blob/main/specs/volumes/pod.yaml)
with two containers that use an `emptyDir` volume to exchange data:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/main/specs/volumes/pod.yaml
```
```bash
kubectl describe pod sharevol
```
```cat
Name:                   sharevol
Namespace:              default
...
Volumes:
  xchange:
    Type:       EmptyDir (a temporary directory that shares a pod's lifetime)
    Medium:
```

We first exec into one of the containers in the pod, `c1`, check the volume mount
and generate some data:

```bash
kubectl exec -it sharevol -c c1 -- bash
```
```bash
mount | grep xchange
```
```cat
/dev/vda3 on /tmp/xchange type xfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,rjquota)
```
```bash
echo 'some data' > /tmp/xchange/data
```

exit the pod to continue
```bash
exit
```

When we now exec into `c2`, the second container running in the pod, we can see
the volume mounted at `/tmp/data` and are able to read the data created in the
previous step:

```bash
kubectl exec -it sharevol -c c2 -- bash
```
```bash
mount | grep /tmp/data
```
```cat
/dev/vda3 on /tmp/data type xfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,prjquota)
```

```bash
cat /tmp/data/data/
```
```cat
cat: /tmp/data/data/: Not a directory
```
```bash
cat /tmp/data/data
```
```cat
some data
```

Note that in each container you need to decide where to mount the volume and
that for `emptyDir` you currently can not specify resource consumption limits.

return to continue
```bash
exit
```

You can remove the pod with:

```bash
kubectl delete pod/sharevol
```

As already described, this will destroy the shared volume and all its contents.
