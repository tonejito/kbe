In order to verify if a container in a pod is healthy and ready to serve traffic,
Kubernetes provides for a range of health checking mechanisms. Health checks,
or **probes** as they are called in Kubernetes, are carried out
by the [kubelet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kubelet/) to determine when to
restart a container (for `livenessProbe`) and used by services and deployments to determine if a pod should receive traffic (for `readinessProbe`).

We will focus on HTTP health checks in the following. Note that it is the responsibility
of the application developer to expose a URL that the kubelet can
use to determine if the container is healthy (and potentially ready).

Let's create a [pod](https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/blob/main/specs/healthz/pod.yaml)
that exposes an endpoint `/health`, responding with a HTTP `200` status code:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/main/specs/healthz/pod.yaml
```

In the pod specification we've defined the following:

```cat
livenessProbe:
  initialDelaySeconds: 2
  periodSeconds: 5
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 9876
```

Above means that Kubernetes will start checking the `/health` endpoint, after initially waiting 2 seconds, every 5 seconds. 

If we now look at the pod we can see that it is considered healthy:

```bash
kubectl describe pod hc
```
```cat
Name:                   hc
Namespace:              default
Security Policy:        anyuid

```

Now we launch a [bad pod](https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/blob/main/specs/healthz/badpod.yaml),
that is, a pod that has a container that randomly (in the time range 1 to 4 sec)
does not return a 200 code:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/main/specs/healthz/badpod.yaml
```

Looking at the events of the bad pod, we can see that the health check failed:

```bash
kubectl describe pod badpod
```
```cat
...

  23s           23s             1       {kubelet 192.168.99.100}        spec.containers{sise}   Normal          Created         Created container with docker id ec63dc3edfaa; Security:[seccomp=unconfined]

```

This can also be verified as follows:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
```cat
NAME                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
badpod                    1/1       Running   4          2m
hc                        1/1       Running   0          6m
```

From above you can see that the `badpod` had already been re-launched 4 times,
since the health check failed.

In addition to a `livenessProbe` you can also specify a `readinessProbe`, which
can be configured in the same way but has a different use case and semantics:
it's used to check the start-up phase of a container in the pod. Imagine a container
that loads some data from external storage such as S3 or a database that needs
to initialize some tables. In this case you want to signal when the container is
ready to serve traffic.

Let's create a [pod](https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/blob/main/specs/healthz/ready.yaml)
with a `readinessProbe` that kicks in after 10 seconds:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/main/specs/healthz/ready.yaml
```

Looking at the events of the pod, we can see that, eventually, the pod is ready
to serve traffic:

```bash
kubectl describe pod ready
```
```cat
...
Conditions:                                                                                                                                                               [0/1888]
  Type          Status
  Initialized   True
  Ready         True
  PodScheduled  True
...
```
You can remove all the created pods with:

```bash
kubectl delete pod/hc pod/ready pod/badpod
```
