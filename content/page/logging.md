Logging is one option to understand what is going on inside your applications
and the cluster at large. Basic logging in Kubernetes makes the output a
container produces available, which is a good use case for debugging. More advanced
[setups](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/) consider logs across nodes and store
them in a central place, either within the cluster or via a dedicated (cloud-based) service.

Let's create a [pod](https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/blob/main/specs/logging/pod.yaml)
called `logme` that runs a container writing to `stdout` and `stderr`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/main/specs/logging/pod.yaml
```

To view the five most recent log lines of the `gen` container in the `logme` pod,
execute:

```bash
kubectl logs --tail=5 logme -c gen
```
```cat
Thu Apr 27 11:34:40 UTC 2017
Thu Apr 27 11:34:41 UTC 2017
Thu Apr 27 11:34:41 UTC 2017
Thu Apr 27 11:34:42 UTC 2017
Thu Apr 27 11:34:42 UTC 2017
```

To stream the log of the `gen` container in the `logme` pod (like `tail -f`), do:

```bash
kubectl logs -f --since=10s logme -c gen
```
```cat
Thu Apr 27 11:43:11 UTC 2017
Thu Apr 27 11:43:11 UTC 2017
Thu Apr 27 11:43:12 UTC 2017
Thu Apr 27 11:43:12 UTC 2017
Thu Apr 27 11:43:13 UTC 2017
...
```

Note that if you wouldn't have specified `--since=10s` in the above command, you
would have gotten all log lines from the start of the container.

You can also view logs of pods that have already completed their lifecycle.
For this we create a [pod](https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/blob/main/specs/logging/oneshotpod.yaml)
called `oneshot` that counts down from 9 to 1 and then exits. Using the `-p` option
you can print the logs for previous instances of the container in a pod:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/main/specs/logging/oneshotpod.yaml
```
```bash
kubectl logs -p oneshot -c gen
```
```cat
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
```

You can remove the created pods with:

```bash
kubectl delete pod/logme pod/oneshot
```
