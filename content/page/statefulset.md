If you have a stateless app you want to use a deployment. However, for a stateful app you might want to use a [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/). Unlike a deployment, the `StatefulSet` provides certain guarantees about the identity of the pods it is managing (that is, predictable names) and about the startup order. Two more things that are different compared to a deployment: for network communication you need to create a [headless services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services) and for persistency the `StatefulSet` manages a [persistent volume](../pv) per pod.

In order to see how this all plays together, we will be using an [educational Kubernetes-native NoSQL datastore](https://blog.openshift.com/kubernetes-statefulset-in-action/).

Let's start with creating the [stateful app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-evangelists/mehdb/main/app.yaml), that is, the `StatefulSet` along with the persistent volumes and the headless service:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-evangelists/mehdb/main/app.yaml
```

After a minute or so, you can have a look at all the resources that have been created:

```bash
kubectl get sts,po,pvc,svc
```
```cat
NAME                     DESIRED   CURRENT   AGE
statefulset.apps/mehdb   2         2         1m

NAME          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/mehdb-0   1/1     Running   0          1m
pod/mehdb-1   1/1     Running   0          56s

NAME                                 STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
persistentvolumeclaim/data-mehdb-0   Bound    pvc-bc2d9b3b-310d-11e9-aeff-123713f594ec   1Gi        RWO            ebs            1m
persistentvolumeclaim/data-mehdb-1   Bound    pvc-d4b7620f-310d-11e9-aeff-123713f594ec   1Gi        RWO            ebs            56s

NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/mehdb   ClusterIP   None         <none>        9876/TCP   1m
```

Now we can check if the stateful app is working properly. To do this, we use the `/status` endpoint of the headless service `mehdb:9876` and since we haven't put any data yet into the datastore, we'd expect that `0` keys are reported:

```bash
kubectl run -it --rm jumpod --restart=Never --image=quay.io/openshiftlabs/jump:0.2 -- curl -s mehdb:9876/status?level=full
```
```cat
0
pod "jumpod" deleted
```

And indeed we see `0` keys being available, reported above.

Note that sometimes a `StatefulSet` is not the best fit for your stateful app. You might be better off defining a [custom resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) along with writing a custom controller to have finer-grained control over your workload.

We can now cleanup after we are done using:

```bash
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-evangelists/mehdb/main/app.yaml
kubectl delete pvc/data-mehdb-0
```
