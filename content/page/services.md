A service is an abstraction for pods, providing a stable, so called virtual IP (VIP) address. While pods may come and go and with it their IP addresses, a service allows clients to reliably connect to the containers running in the pod using the VIP. The `virtual` in VIP means it is not an actual IP address connected to a network interface, but its purpose is purely to forward traffic to one or more pods. Keeping the mapping between the VIP and the
pods up-to-date is the job of [kube-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kube-proxy/), a process that runs on every node, which queries the API server to learn about
new services in the cluster.

Let's create a pod supervised by an [RC](https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/blob/main/specs/services/rc.yaml)
and a [service](https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/blob/main/specs/services/svc.yaml)
along with it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/main/specs/services/rc.yaml
```
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/main/specs/services/svc.yaml
```

Now we have the supervised pod running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=sise
```
```cat
NAME           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
rcsise-6nq3k   1/1       Running   0          57s
```

A new pod name should be generated each time this example is run. Make sure to include your own pod name when running the following examples:

```bash
kubectl describe pod rcsise-6nq3k
```
```cat
Name:                   rcsise-6nq3k
Namespace:              default
Security Policy:        restricted
Node:                   localhost/192.168.99.100
Start Time:             Tue, 25 Apr 2017 14:47:45 +0100
Labels:                 app=sise
Status:                 Running
IP:                     172.17.0.3
Controllers:            ReplicationController/rcsise
Containers:
...
```

You can, from within the cluster, access the pod directly via its assigned IP `172.17.0.3`:

```bash
kubectl exec rcsise-6nq3k -t -- curl -s 172.17.0.3:9876/info
```
```cat
{"host": "172.17.0.3:9876", "version": "0.5.0", "from": "172.17.0.1"}
```

This is however, as mentioned above, not advisable since the IPs assigned
to pods may change as pods are migrated or rescheduled.  Hence, enter the included `simpleservice` service endpoint example:

```bash
kubectl get svc
```
```cat
NAME              CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                   AGE
simpleservice     172.30.228.255   <none>        80/TCP                    5m
```
```bash
kubectl describe svc simpleservice
```
```cat
Name:                   simpleservice
Namespace:              default
Labels:                 <none>
Selector:               app=sise
Type:                   ClusterIP
IP:                     172.30.228.255
Port:                   <unset> 80/TCP
Endpoints:              172.17.0.3:9876
Session Affinity:       None
No events.
```

The `service` resource uses labels to identify which pods it will forward traffic to. In our case, pods labeled with `app=sise` will receive traffic.

From within the cluster, we can now access any affiliated pods using the IP address of the `simpleservice` svc endpoint on port `80`:

```bash
kubectl exec rcsise-6nq3k -t -- curl -s 172.30.228.255:80/info
```
```cat
{"host": "172.30.228.255", "version": "0.5.0", "from": "10.0.2.15"}
```

KubeDNS even provides basic name resolution for kubernetes `services` (within the same kubernetes namespace). This allows us to connect to pods using the associated service name - No need to including IP addresses or port numbers!

```bash
kubectl exec rcsise-6nq3k -t -- curl -s simpleservice/info
```
```cat
{"host": "simpleservice", "version": "0.5.0", "from": "10.0.2.15"}
```

What makes the VIP `172.30.228.255` forward the traffic to the pod?
The answer is: [IPtables](https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Network/IPTables),
which is essentially a long list of rules that tells the Linux kernel what to do
with a certain IP package.

Looking at the rules that concern our service (executed on a cluster node) yields:

```bash
minikube ssh
```
```bash
sudo iptables-save | grep simpleservice
```
```cat
-A KUBE-SEP-4SQFZS32ZVMTQEZV -s 172.17.0.3/32 -m comment --comment "default/simpleservice:" -j KUBE-MARK-MASQ
-A KUBE-SEP-4SQFZS32ZVMTQEZV -p tcp -m comment --comment "default/simpleservice:" -m tcp -j DNAT --to-destination 172.17.0.3:9876
-A KUBE-SERVICES -d 172.30.228.255/32 -p tcp -m comment --comment "default/simpleservice: cluster IP" -m tcp --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-EZC6WLOVQADP4IAW
-A KUBE-SVC-EZC6WLOVQADP4IAW -m comment --comment "default/simpleservice:" -j KUBE-SEP-4SQFZS32ZVMTQEZV
```

exit the pod to continue
```bash
exit
```

Above you can see the four rules that `kube-proxy` has thankfully added to the
routing table, essentially stating that TCP traffic to `172.30.228.255:80`
should be forwarded to `172.17.0.3:9876`, which is our pod.

Letâ€™s now add a second pod by scaling up the RC supervising it:

```bash
kubectl scale --replicas=2 rc/rcsise
```
```cat
replicationcontroller "rcsise" scaled
```

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=sise
```
```cat
NAME           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
rcsise-6nq3k   1/1       Running   0          15m
rcsise-nv8zm   1/1       Running   0          5s
```

When we now check the relevant parts of the routing table again we notice
the addition of a bunch of IPtables rules:

```bash
minikube ssh
```
```bash
sudo iptables-save | grep simpleservice
```
```cat
-A KUBE-SEP-4SQFZS32ZVMTQEZV -s 172.17.0.3/32 -m comment --comment "default/simpleservice:" -j KUBE-MARK-MASQ
-A KUBE-SEP-4SQFZS32ZVMTQEZV -p tcp -m comment --comment "default/simpleservice:" -m tcp -j DNAT --to-destination 172.17.0.3:9876
-A KUBE-SEP-PXYYII6AHMUWKLYX -s 172.17.0.4/32 -m comment --comment "default/simpleservice:" -j KUBE-MARK-MASQ
-A KUBE-SEP-PXYYII6AHMUWKLYX -p tcp -m comment --comment "default/simpleservice:" -m tcp -j DNAT --to-destination 172.17.0.4:9876
-A KUBE-SERVICES -d 172.30.228.255/32 -p tcp -m comment --comment "default/simpleservice: cluster IP" -m tcp --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-EZC6WLOVQADP4IAW
-A KUBE-SVC-EZC6WLOVQADP4IAW -m comment --comment "default/simpleservice:" -m statistic --mode random --probability 0.50000000000 -j KUBE-SEP-4SQFZS32ZVMTQEZV
-A KUBE-SVC-EZC6WLOVQADP4IAW -m comment --comment "default/simpleservice:" -j KUBE-SEP-PXYYII6AHMUWKLYX
```

In above routing table listing we see rules for the newly created pod serving at
`172.17.0.4:9876` as well as an additional rule:

```cat
-A KUBE-SVC-EZC6WLOVQADP4IAW -m comment --comment "default/simpleservice:" -m statistic --mode random --probability 0.50000000000 -j KUBE-SEP-4SQFZS32ZVMTQEZV
```

return to continue
```bash
exit
```

This causes the traffic to the service being equally split between our two pods
by invoking the `statistics` module of IPtables.

You can remove all the resources created by doing:

```bash
kubectl delete svc simpleservice
```

```bash
kubectl delete rc rcsise
```
