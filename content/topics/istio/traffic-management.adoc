== Istio Traffic Management

Istio implements support for the standard Kubernetes ingress resource, but the functionality is limited.
The full traffic management features of Istio can be configured with the following CRDs.

[compact]
* Gateway
* Virtual service
* Destination rule

=== Gateway

The gateway resource specifies what happens when the traffic is entering or leaving the cluster.
This resource has a set of hostnames to match against incoming traffic and a list of network ports that are exposed to network traffic.

The gateway resource has the following fields on the YAML manifest.

`selector`::
The selector specifies the Istio ingress gateway to use for this resource.
The gateway configuration will be applied to the envoy proxy running on a pod with the specified label.
+
[NOTE]
====
The default ingress gateway has the `istio=ingressgateway` label applied.

[source,bash]
----
[user@host kbe]$ kubectl get pods -l 'istio=ingressgateway' -n istio-system
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS     AGE
istio-ingressgateway-78f69bd5db-s5pjz   1/1     Running   1 (1d ago)   4d
----
====

`servers`::
The servers section is a list of host and ports that will be matched against incoming HTTP traffic.
The host can be set to a specific DNS name, wildcards such as `\*.example.com` are supported, and it can be defined as `'*'` to match all hostnames.
+
[NOTE]
====
There are other configurations for TLS and SNI that can be applied to this resource, but they are outside the scope of this section.
====

The following is an example of an gateway resource manifest.

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: bookinfo-gateway
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway  # <1>
  servers:
  - hosts:
    - "bookinfo.192.168.59.20.nip.io"  # <2>
    port:  # <3>
      name: http
      number: 80
      protocol: HTTP
----
<1> Use the Istio default ingress gateway.
<2> DNS host name where the gateway will serve traffic.
<3> Port number where the proxy will listen for incoming connections.

=== Virtual Service

The virtual service resource defines a set of rules to match the HTTP traffic and the backend service name and port number to forward the traffic if the request match.

The virtual service resource has the following fields on the YAML manifest.

`gateways`::
Specifies the Istio gateway that will handle the incoming traffic.

`hosts`::
List of host names to match the HTTP traffic.
The host can be set to a specific DNS name, wildcards such as `\*.example.com` are supported, and it can be defined as `'*'` to match all hostnames.

`http`::
List of rules to match against incoming HTTP traffic.

`match`::
Specifies the URI to perform a case-sensitive match for either the `exact` path, treat the path as a `prefix`, or provide a `regex` for matching.

`route`::
Specifies the backend service host and port number that will process the request.
Each route can have a weight to configure which percentage of the traffic should be forwarded to a given destination.

The following is an example of an virtual service resource manifest.

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: bookinfo
spec:
  gateways:
  - bookinfo-gateway  # <1>
  hosts:
  - "bookinfo.192.168.59.20.nip.io"  # <2>
  http:  # <3>
  - match:  # <4>
    - uri:
        exact: /productpage
    - uri:
        prefix: /static
    - uri:
        exact: /login
    - uri:
        exact: /logout
    - uri:
        prefix: /api/v1/products
    route:  # <5>
    - destination:
        host: productpage
        port:
          number: 9080
----
<1> Apply the virtual service rules to the specified gateway in the current namespace.
<2> DNS host name where the gateway will serve traffic.
<3> List of routing rules for the HTTP traffic.
<4> List of rules to match against incoming requests.
<5> The matching requests will be forwarded to this service and port number.

The virtual service resource can also work with link:#_destination_rule[destination rules] to specify different subsets or service versions, and route part of the traffic to them.

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - weight: 10  # <1>
      destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
    - weight: 30  # <2>
      destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
    - weight: 60  # <3>
      destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v3
----
<1> 10% of the traffic will be redirected to `reviews` subset `v1`.
<2> 30% of the traffic will be redirected to `reviews` subset `v2`.
<3> 60% of the traffic will be redirected to `reviews` subset `v3`.

[NOTE]
====
The total sum of the route weights should be 100, otherwise the admission hook will raise a validation error when creating or patching the resource.

[source,bash]
----
[user@host kbe]$ kubectl edit virtualservice/reviews -n bookinfo
error: virtualservices.networking.istio.io "reviews" could not be patched:
admission webhook "validation.istio.io" denied the request:
configuration is invalid: total destination weight 90 != 100
----
====

=== Destination Rule

This resource defines configurations that take place after the routing has been performed, and you can specify a subset of the service pods by matching a set of labels to differentiate service versions.

The destination rule resource has the following fields on the YAML manifest.

`host`::
The name of the backend service on the Kubernetes cluster.

`subsets`::
Defines the service subset, this can be used to distribute traffic between different versions of the service.

`labels`::
The labels to match the destination pod.

The following resource definition specifies that there are three versions of the service and that different percentages of the traffic will be routed to each one.

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  host: reviews
  subsets:
  - name: v1  # <1>
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2  # <2>
    labels:
      version: v2
  - name: v3  # <3>
    labels:
      version: v3
----
<1> The subset `v1` references pods with label `version: v1`.
<2> The subset `v2` references pods with label `version: v2`.
<3> The subset `v3` references pods with label `version: v3`.
