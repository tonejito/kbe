== Istio Ingress Control

Istio implements the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/[Kubernetes ingress] resource to expose a service and make it accessible from outside the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The general recommendation is to use Istio gateway, and virtual service resources to allow a more complete control over the traffic.
That content is covered in the link:../traffic-management[traffic management] section.

=== Ingress

The Kubernetes ingress resource has a set of rules to match the incoming HTTP traffic to route the request to a back-end service.
// TechEditor: [standards] ‚Å†back end, back-end n. Two words. Refers to software that performs the final stages of a process, or to tasks that are not visible to the user. For example, "each back end provides a set of calls." adj. Hyphenate. For example, "when the back-end database processes a search operation ‚Ä¶" Do not use "backend."
// Please check for all other instances throughout all sections, I wont comment out again.
// CD: Fixed
Each rule matches a DNS name and a set of paths to forward the traffic to a back-end service.

The ingress resource has the following fields on the YAML manifest.

`rules`::
List of rules to match against incoming HTTP traffic.

`host`::
List of host names to match the HTTP traffic.
The host can be set to a specific DNS name, wildcards such as `\*.example.com` are supported, and it can be defined as `'*'` to match all hostnames.

`paths`::
List of URL paths that are matched against HTTP requests.

`pathType`::
* The value `Exact` matches the provided path as is.
* The value `Prefix` matches the provided path if it begins with the specified prefix.

`backend`::
Specifies the service that receives the traffic.

The following code listing is an example of an ingress resource manifest.
// TechEditor: [style] When introducing a list or a procedure, use "following" with a noun. Complete the following (Complete the following steps) (The following command/code block is)

<1> Specifies that Istio handles this ingress resource.
<2> Set of rules to be applied against incoming HTTP traffic.
<3> DNS host name where the ingress serves traffic.
<4> List of paths to match HTTP traffic.
<5> Type of match that should be applied to the path.
<6> Back-end service name and port number.

==== Ingress Class

The annotation is required to tell the Istio gateway controller that it should handle this ingress resource, otherwise is ignored.

[NOTE]
====
The `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation was deprecated in Kubernetes 1.22+.
However, Istio does not support the `ingressClassName` field unless you also modify the Istio ingress class.
