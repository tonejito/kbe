== MetalLB

// MetalLB is a load balancer suitable for local environments, it is included as an add-on in `minikube`.

The Kubernetes clusters deployed in cloud environments use the functionality from the provider to dynamically provision managed load balancers for the services of type LoadBalancer.
MetalLB implements the load balancer functionality for local or bare metal Kubernetes clusters that are not deployed in cloud environments.

=== Kubernetes Service Types

Kubernetes has three types of services:

ClusterIP::
The ClusterIP service assigns an internal IP address to the service, making it accessible only within the cluster.

NodePort::
The NodePort service assigns a random port number on the node to expose the service endpoint.
You can reach the service from outside the cluster specifying the node IP address and the port number.

LoadBalancer::
The LoadBalancer service uses the cloud controller manager to request a managed load balancer from the cloud provider.
+
+
[NOTE]
====
Bare metal and local clusters such as minikube do not have this functionality and load balancer services always get a `<pending>` value for the external IP address.
====
// TechEditor: [standards] We do not use contractions and avoid the term "will" wherever possible - - FIXED

=== MetalLB Features

MetalLB provides a load balancer implementation that can be configured to use ARP (layer 2) or BGP (layer 3) to announce service IP addresses.

ARP::
The service IP address is published by sending ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) responses in the local network.
This method operates in the data link layer of the OSI model (layer 2).
+
The administrator only has to provide an IP address range to be used by MetalLB.

BGP::
The service IP address is published with BGP requests to the router.
This method operates in the network layer of the OSI model (layer 3).
+
The administrator has to provide the following items to configure MetalLB with BGP:
+
[compact]
* The IP address of the router.
* The AS (Autonomous System) number of the router.
* A private AS number to be used by MetalLB.
* The IP address range CIDR prefix to be used by MetalLB.
+
+
[NOTE]
====
The BGP configuration method is outside the scope of this material.
====

=== MetalLB components

MetalLB has two components

controller::
It is the main MetalLB component that tracks the creation of the load balancer services and allocates the IP addresses.
The controller pod is executed from a deployment.

speaker::
Manages the advertisement of the IP address associated with them.
The speaker daemon set will run a pod on every node
+
When configured in layer 2 mode, the speaker application will send Gratuitous ARP messages for IPv4 addresses and Unsolicited Neighbour Advertisement for IPv6.
If the configuration is in layer 3, then speaker will send BGP advertisements.
// TechEditor: [standards] Avoid future tense (or using the term "will") whenever possible.

=== MetalLB installation options

There are various methods to install MetalLB in a Kubernetes cluster:

* Apply the YAML manifests from the https://github.com/metallb/metallb/tree/v0.12.1/manifests[MetalLB repository].

* Install with `kustomize` and reference the https://github.com/metallb/metallb/raw/v0.12.1/manifests/kustomization.yaml[`kustomization.yaml` file in the source repository]
// TechEditor: [misc] Should this be in brackets or is this a mistake? file in the source repository]

* Add the https://metallb.github.io/metallb[chart repository] and deploy the `metallb/metallb` chart with `helm`.

* Install the https://operatorhub.io/operator/metallb-operator[MetalLB Operator] from OperatorHub.

* Enable the `metallb` add-on in minikube.

=== Installing MetalLB in Minikube

Minikube clusters have the option to install MetalLB as an add-on.
To install MetalLB on minikube, check if the add-on is listed.
// TechEditor: [terminology] Avoid the use of "check." Use a verb that describes exactly what you mean, e.g., review, verify, inspect, validate, determine...

[source,bash]

    ‚ñ™ Using image metallb/speaker:v0.9.6
üåü  The 'metallb' addon is enabled
----

Configure the add-on with the range of IP addresses that MetalLB will use for the load balancer services.
// TechEditor: [standards] Avoid future tense (or using the term "will") whenever possible. For example, future tense ("The screen will display...") does not read as well as the present tense ("The screen displays...").

[source,bash]
----
[user@host kbe]$ minikube addons configure metallb
-- Enter Load Balancer Start IP: 192.168.59.20
-- Enter Load Balancer End IP: 192.168.59.30
    ‚ñ™ Using image metallb/speaker:v0.9.6
    ‚ñ™ Using image metallb/controller:v0.9.6
‚úÖ  metallb was successfully configured
----

[NOTE]
====
The load balancer IP address range for MetalLB must not overlap with the DHCP IP address range.
====

The configuration step created a configuration map named `config` in the `metallb-system` namespace with the MetalLB layer 2 settings.
You can edit this configuration map to change the settings.

The IP address pool for MetalLB can be specified as `<start-address>-<end-address>` or a CIDR block such as `192.0.2.0/24`.

=== Troubleshooting MetalLB

MetalLB creates an endpoint resource with the same name as the load balancer service, verify that the endpoint has an IP address and port number and is not in the `<pending>` state.

[source,bash]
----
[user@host kbe]$ kubectl get endpoints nginx
NAME    ENDPOINTS        AGE
nginx   172.17.0.19:80   27m
----

Under some circumstances the load balancer service IP address will refuse connections, even if it is has an external IP address provided by MetalLB.

[source,bash]
----
[user@host kbe]$ kubectl get services -l app=nginx
NAME    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
nginx   LoadBalancer   10.102.69.228   192.168.59.20   80:30574/TCP   60s
----

////
When this happens, clients are unable to connect to the application.

[source,bash]
----
[user@host kbe]$ curl -vk# "http://192.168.59.20:80/"
*   Trying 192.168.59.20...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* connect to 192.168.59.20 port 80 failed: Connection refused
* Failed to connect to 192.168.59.20 port 80: Connection refused
* Closing connection 0
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 192.168.59.20 port 80: Connection refused
----
////

You can verify if the TCP connection to the service can be established by using `netcat`.
// TechEditor: [standards] Using - IBM Style Guide: To avoid ambiguity, replace this gerund with either "by using" or "that uses." To refer to something "using" one thing or another is often ambiguous. - - FIXED

[source,bash]
----
[user@host kbe]$ nc -vz 192.168.59.20 80
Ncat: Version 7.70 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Connection refused.
----

You can also review if the IP address range is not set in the configuration map for MetalLB.

[source,bash]
----
[user@host kbe]$ kubectl get configmap config -n metallb-system -o yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: config
data:
  config: |
    address-pools:
    - name: default
      protocol: layer2
      addresses:
      - -  # <1>
----
<1> The IP address range is empty.

You can assign or change the IP address range for MetalLB by editing the configuration map.

[source,bash]
----
[user@host kbe]$ kubectl edit configmap config -n metallb-system
configmap/config edited
----

[NOTE]
====
You can also extract the resource as YAML, edit the file and apply the resource again to commit the changes.
====

After the IP address range is configured, the components must be rolled out to apply the changes.
// TechEditor: [standards] prefer "must" over "need to" - - FIXED

[source,bash]
----
[user@host kbe]$ kubectl rollout restart deployment controller -n metallb-system
deployment.apps/controller restarted

[user@host kbe]$ kubectl rollout restart daemonset speaker -n metallb-system
daemonset.apps/speaker restarted

[user@host kbe]$ kubectl get pods -n metallb-system
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
controller-6884978f-l5q4w   1/1     Running   0          20s
speaker-qzxtr               1/1     Running   0          10s
----

You can verify if the service responds after all the components are restarted.

[source,bash]
----
[user@host kbe]$ kubectl get services -l app=nginx
NAME    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
nginx   LoadBalancer   10.102.69.228   192.168.59.20   80:30574/TCP   60s

[user@host kbe]$ nc -vz 192.168.59.20 80
Ncat: Version 7.70 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Connected to 192.168.59.20 80.
Ncat: 0 bytes sent, 0 bytes received in 0.01 seconds.
----

You can also check if the IP address of the service is associated with the MAC address of the minikube VM.

[source,bash]
----
[user@host kbe]$ minikube ssh

...output omitted...

$ ip addr show dev eth1
3: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 08:00:27:56:de:f2 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff  # <1>
    inet 192.168.59.123/24 brd 192.168.59.255 scope global dynamic eth1
       valid_lft 586sec preferred_lft 586sec

$ exit
logout
----
<1> The MAC address is `08:00:27:56:de:f2`

Delete the entry for the service IP address from the ARP table on the client machine.

[source,bash]
----
[root@host ~]# arp -d 192.168.59.20

[root@host ~]# arp -d 192.168.59.20
No ARP entry for 192.168.59.20
----

Use the `arping` tool to discover which MAC address is associated with the IP address of the service.

[source,bash]
----
[root@host ~]# arping -c 4 -I vboxnet0 192.168.59.20
ARPING 192.168.59.20 from 192.168.59.1 vboxnet0
